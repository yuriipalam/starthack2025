    response: `${stockName}'s stock price increase of ${changePercent.toFixed(2)}% demonstrates robust fundamental strength. Key drivers include: 1) Quarterly earnings exceeded consensus by 15%, with revenue growth of 22% YoY and margin expansion of 250bps, 2) Strong free cash flow conversion at 85% indicates operational efficiency, 3) Market share gains in core segments (+5% YoY) reflect competitive advantages. Technical indicators suggest sustained momentum with RSI at 65 and positive MACD crossover. Institutional ownership has increased by 12% this quarter, indicating growing confidence. Consider this trajectory in the context of the sector's average growth of 8% YTD.`,

  "significant rise": (stockName) => ({
    response: `${stockName}'s remarkable performance is underpinned by multiple strategic advantages: 1) Industry-leading R&D investment ratio of 15% of revenue, resulting in 28 new patent filings, 2) Strategic acquisitions including the recent $2.5B deal expanding TAM by 40%, 3) Market share expansion from 23% to 31% in core segments. Key financial metrics show: Operating margin improvement of 400bps YoY, debt-to-EBITDA ratio reduction to 1.2x, and working capital optimization leading to 15% improvement in cash conversion cycle. The company's ESG initiatives and sustainable practices have also attracted significant institutional capital, with ESG-focused funds increasing their positions by 25%.`,

  "stock price decreased": (stockName, changePercent) => ({
    response: `${stockName}'s stock price decline of ${Math.abs(changePercent).toFixed(2)}% warrants contextual analysis: 1) The decline occurs against a backdrop of sector-wide multiple compression (sector P/E down 15%), 2) Company's fundamentals remain strong with 18% ROE and 25% ROIC, significantly above peer average, 3) Balance sheet strength persists with $4.2B cash reserves and 2.5x interest coverage ratio. Technical analysis shows oversold conditions with RSI at 32, suggesting potential mean reversion. The current price level presents a compelling valuation at 0.8x PEG ratio compared to industry average of 1.2x. Consider this correction an opportunity to evaluate position sizing within risk parameters.`,

  "significant drop": (stockName) => ({
    response: `${stockName}'s significant decline requires multi-factor analysis: 1) Supply chain disruptions have temporarily impacted gross margins (-300bps), but mitigation strategies including supplier diversification and inventory optimization are underway, 2) R&D setbacks in key projects have delayed product launches by 2 quarters, however, the pipeline remains robust with 15 projects in late-stage development, 3) Market share remains stable at 28% despite competitive pressures. Current valuation metrics (P/E: 12x, EV/EBITDA: 8x) are at 5-year lows, while the company maintains strong liquidity (current ratio: 2.5x) and minimal refinancing risk with no major debt maturities until 2026. Management's share buyback authorization of $5B signals confidence in long-term value.`,

  "relatively high": (stockName, _, price) => ({
    response: `${stockName}'s premium valuation at $${price} is supported by compelling metrics: 1) Industry-leading EBITDA margins of 35% (+500bps vs peers), 2) Robust organic growth rate of 15% CAGR over 3 years, 3) High barriers to entry reinforced by 180+ patents and 65% market share in premium segments. Financial health indicators are exceptional: FCF yield of 6%, ROIC of 22%, and net cash position of $3.8B. The company's moat is widening through network effects, with customer acquisition costs decreasing 25% YoY while lifetime value increased 40%. Growth vectors include geographical expansion (35% international revenue target) and adjacent market opportunities ($50B TAM).`,

  "relatively low": (stockName, _, price) => ({
    response: `${stockName}'s current price of $${price} presents a compelling risk-reward proposition: 1) Trading at 0.7x PEG ratio versus historical average of 1.1x, 2) Strong fundamentals with 20% ROE and 30% gross margins remain intact, 3) Market uncertainty has created temporary dislocation - company's beta of 1.2 has led to oversized reaction to market volatility. Balance sheet strength (net cash position, 3x current ratio) provides downside protection and optionality for opportunistic M&A. The company's digital transformation initiatives target $500M in cost savings by 2025, while strategic investments in AI/ML capabilities position it well for next-generation product development.`,

  "high volatility": (stockName) => ({
    response: `${stockName}'s volatility metrics require careful analysis: 1) 30-day realized volatility of 45% vs sector average of 28% reflects temporary market dynamics rather than fundamental issues, 2) Beta has increased to 1.4 from historical 1.1, creating hedging opportunities, 3) Options implied volatility skew suggests market uncertainty about near-term catalysts. Key stability factors include: Diversified revenue streams (no single customer >5% of revenue), geographical diversification (operations in 40+ countries), and strong working capital management (15% improvement in cash conversion cycle). Technical support levels exist at key moving averages (50-day MA: $X, 200-day MA: $Y).`,
